libcommons-lang-java for Debian
-------------------------------

dist/docs and dist/RELEASE-NOTES.txt have been removed because the doc
is no more generated (the package is not generated by ant at the moment)

debian/MANIFEST.MF has been extracted from the official commons-lang.jar and
it may need to be updated for new releases.
